# SCT_DS_03
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. It involves developing algorithms that can analyze and interpret data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time with minimal human intervention.

Decision Tree Classifier: Predicting Customer Purchase Behavior
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a product or service based on their demographic information. The project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries to create a predictive model, providing a step-by-step guide for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Features
Input data includes customer demographic attributes such as:
Age
Gender
Income level
Occupation
Location
The output predicts the likelihood of a customer making a purchase.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Normalizing numerical features (if necessary).
Model Development:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Building a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn.
Visualizing the tree structure for interpretability.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Plotting the confusion matrix for better insights.
Deployment (optional):

Exporting the trained model.
Deploying it as a REST API or using it in applications.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualizations)
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-classifier.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.
Use Case
This project is ideal for businesses aiming to understand customer behavior and improve marketing strategies by predicting purchase intent based on customer demographics.
